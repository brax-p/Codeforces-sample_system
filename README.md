# Codeforces-sample_system

This is my personal system for CLI sample/test cases for codeforces. It involves scraping for information related to contests -- problem count, problem indexes, and then subsequent test case input/output for each index. This assumes the use of c++. The check problem system checks the output via standard output from each indexed cpp file and compares to the file contents designated by {index}.out, previously scraped from codeforces.
